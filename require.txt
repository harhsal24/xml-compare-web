The code doen't work with big xml files

After comparing 2 large xml file it frezees below issues are shown 
1) In tree view styling is breaking like the toogalable box leafnode
2) In tree view sometimes values don't get shown 
3) I want a setting to customize tree view 
like to turn on and off border in tree view, also transfer font size 
4)I file path is to log i wont fit in xpath that shown below

1) I dont want a Toggle button for debuge mode or not use hardcode value no UI 
2) I want want my legend back so select and want arrow key to navigate in xml 
   based on seletected legend
3) In tree view mode I want a option in settings to choose styling of element 
  in tree and I want none option also I want it to look like view only mode 
4) find a empty space in zen mode to show legend and arrows keys to navigate 



1) I adjust the legend into left file head to save spce create icons with initial letter 
2) show arrow keys in header to navigate
3) instead of removing border from tree view I want option to remove dot from child elemet 
 when it started , option to remove message at the end in tree view

1)In zen mode we only have one bar to select the view mode  so chage both view 
when we change that in zen mode and there is no need to specify left xml and right xml 
 in zen mode 
2) show folder icon to show upload in zen mode
3) update the setting bar in zen mode
 remove the pill message that says user arrow key to navigate thats it 




 1) select legend is not working and navigate is also not working  ,
 2) setting bar 
      1) Toogle borders is working with it is also removing vertical lines 
      that shows the element and its area 
      2)toogle tree style is not working  so remove that icon and its code
      3)toogle leaf dot its not working
      4)toogle status badge is not working
3) add compare button in zen mode in right panel heder in the middle

1) add option to lock vertical and horizontal scroll
   1) calculate the horizontal scroll based on 
   file which is long horizontally
   3) calculate the vertical scroll based on 
   file which is long vertically



   I want to show  the index of element 
if a parent have mutiple childrean with same name 
i want it like <element>2/5 
where 2 is its index from similar 5 sibliings 
i dont want to see 1/1
i only want it if we have same mutiple more than 1 


I want a way to copy the value of the leaf node 
can you copy the value if ctrl key is pressed and mouse click on leaf node 



I want to add 2 features 
where 
1)when we have a extra element if a file we will leaf same amout of space in other file indicate a element suppose to be here 
2) if user want to find a element he will  have a 
xpath copied in his clipboard 
if he pressed alt + f 
we will get that copied value (if this is possible)
and search in last focused panel
