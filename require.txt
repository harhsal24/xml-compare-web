The code doen't work with big xml files

After comparing 2 large xml file it frezees below issues are shown 
1) In tree view styling is breaking like the toogalable box leafnode
2) In tree view sometimes values don't get shown 
3) I want a setting to customize tree view 
like to turn on and off border in tree view, also transfer font size 
4)I file path is to log i wont fit in xpath that shown below

1) I dont want a Toggle button for debuge mode or not use hardcode value no UI 
2) I want want my legend back so select and want arrow key to navigate in xml 
   based on seletected legend
3) In tree view mode I want a option in settings to choose styling of element 
  in tree and I want none option also I want it to look like view only mode 
4) find a empty space in zen mode to show legend and arrows keys to navigate 



1) I adjust the legend into left file head to save spce create icons with initial letter 
2) show arrow keys in header to navigate
3) instead of removing border from tree view I want option to remove dot from child elemet 
 when it started , option to remove message at the end in tree view

1)In zen mode we only have one bar to select the view mode  so chage both view 
when we change that in zen mode and there is no need to specify left xml and right xml 
 in zen mode 
2) show folder icon to show upload in zen mode
3) update the setting bar in zen mode
 remove the pill message that says user arrow key to navigate thats it
